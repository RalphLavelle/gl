## To run
> npm run dev  

Then browse [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Search
I created a search widget for the navbar at top, and had a (nearly) working component, but realised that the [search API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) doesn't allow filtering by folder. There's no way to restrict the search only to the folders Gav wants to include, so it's out, unfortunately. Put the files in '_/archive'.

## Flickr
In case its ever needed, Gav's FLickr id is 51412443@N05
